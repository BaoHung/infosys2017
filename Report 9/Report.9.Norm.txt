1. Which normal form does the employee database satisfy?
The employee database satisfied the third normal form.

2. Why?
- The data is stored in a relational Database.
- The columns contain atomic values.
- No columns are repeated.
- Primary Key and Foreign Key are used to split related data (E.g: employees - dept_emp - departments)
- The non-key columns are depended on the Primary Key.
- There are no columns transitively dependent on the Primary Keys.
